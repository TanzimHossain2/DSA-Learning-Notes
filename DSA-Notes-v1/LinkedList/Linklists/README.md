# Linked List Implementation in C

This C program illustrates the basic implementation of a singly linked list. It includes functions for traversing the linked list and printing its elements.

## Functions:-

1. **LinkListTraversal:**
   - Traverse and print the elements of the linked list.

2. **traversal:**
   - Traverse and print the elements of the linked list.

### Implementation Details:-

The program creates a linked list with four nodes and prints its elements.

#### Usage:-

Compile and run the program to see the linked list traversal in action.

#### Example Output:-

```plaintext
Using LinkListTraversal Function:
Element: 7
Element: 11
Element: 41
Element: 66

Using traversal Function:
Elements are: 7
Elements are: 11
Elements are: 41
Elements are: 66
```

#### Time Complexity:-

- **LinkListTraversal:** O(n) (linear time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the linked list)
- **traversal:** O(n) (linear time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the linked list)

#### Space Complexity:-

- The space complexity for creating the linked list is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
