## Basic Linked List Implementation

The `Linklist.c` file includes a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C. It demonstrates the creation of a linked list with nodes and provides functions for traversing and printing elements.

## Insertion Operations

The `insertionInLinkList.c` file includes code examples for various insertion operations in linked lists, showcasing scenarios like insertion at the beginning, end, a specific index, or after a given node.

## Deletion Operations

The `deletionInLinkList.c` file includes code examples for various deletion operations in linked lists. Cases covered include deleting the first node, deleting at a specific index, deleting the last node, and deleting a node by a given value.

Feel free to explore the code implementations in each file for a better understanding of linked list operations.
