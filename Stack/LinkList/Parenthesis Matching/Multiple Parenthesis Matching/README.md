Certainly! I'll enhance the pseudocode, fix the image path, and create a flowchart for better clarity.

### Multiple Parenthesis Matching Problem

When constructing an expression with brackets, it is crucial to ensure the correct arrangement of brackets, guaranteeing that each opening bracket corresponds to its respective closing bracket.

### Stack Visualization

![Stack Visualization](./../images/stack_visualization.jpg)

Consider the expression:

```text
exp = {7-(3-2)*[(5+6)-(4-2)] + 9}
```

- Opening brackets =  {, (, [, (, (, [ -----> **push**
- Closing brackets = }, ), ], ) , ), ] -----> **pop**

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
Create an empty stack
For each character in the expression:
    If the character is an opening bracket:
        Push it onto the stack
    If the character is a closing bracket:
        If the stack is not empty and the popped element matches the current closing bracket:
            Pop the element from the stack
        Else:
            Return false (expression is unbalanced)
After processing the entire expression:
    If the stack is empty:
        Return true (expression is balanced)
    Else:
        Return false (expression is unbalanced)
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the expression
- Space Complexity: **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the expression
